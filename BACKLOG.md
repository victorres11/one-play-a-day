# OPAD Backlog

## Data Quality
- [ ] **Improve extraction patterns** — Down & distance, personnel, formation info is important but currently missing on many plays
- [ ] **Finish backfill** — Get ALL One Play a Day emails into the database (target: tonight)
- [ ] **Tag formations** — Extract/tag the formation for each play

## Tagging System
- [ ] **Play type tags** — QB runs, trick plays, laterals, pylon sail, scissors, outside zone, red zone plays, etc.
- [ ] **Challenge:** Figure out how to tag properly (manual? AI-assisted? pattern matching on titles?)
- [ ] **Play caller tags** — Who was calling the play for each team when it was run
  - Example: Seattle 2025 → Klint Kubiak
- [ ] **Build play caller database** — Need list of all play callers (NFL + college if possible)

## Features
- [ ] **Filters & search** — Allow filtering, grouping, searching plays
- [ ] **Filter by tags** — Once tagging exists, filter by play type, formation, play caller, etc.

## Content Expansion
- [ ] **Bobby Peters content** — Look into how to incorporate his content

## Research / Data Collection
- [ ] **Coach contract scraping** — Scrape contract details for coaches from public university records
  - Data points: Amount, term, ending year, buyout, incentives
  - Public universities should have this publicly available (FOIA/sunshine laws)
  - Explore: USA Today coach salary databases, state records, sports media sites

## Notes

### Play Caller Research Needed
- NFL: OCs and play callers for each team (2023-2025)
- College: Harder to track — OCs change frequently

### Tagging Approach Ideas
1. Manual tagging (time-consuming but accurate)
2. AI classification based on play title + video
3. Keyword extraction from titles
4. Hybrid: AI suggests, human confirms
